## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Stop creating explicit `cve` and `cwe` entities. Instead, only create mapped
  relationships to `cve` and `cwe` entities that allow the target to be created.
- Use the `/aggregated-issues` endpoint to list issues, which is recommended by
  Snyk, rather than the deprecated `/issues` endpoint.
